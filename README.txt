Thanks for trying PikaNX, the first ever automated CFW!

A few notes before you launch:
- The FTP server can be toggled with Start + Select + X, if you've launched to a configuration with it
- To change your launch configuration, hold Volume Down while you see the PikaNX screen, then go to "Launch Options," then to "Auto boot"
